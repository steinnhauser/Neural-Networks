# Example scripts for neural networks

This repository contains scripts demonstrating how to neural networks from libraries such as Scikit-Learn and Tensorflow 2.0.
Dependencies can be installed using `pipenv`.

## Regression on Franke's function
Surface fitting of Franke's function using a neural network for comparison with [project 1](https://compphysics.github.io/MachineLearning/doc/Projects/2019/Project1/html/Project1.html).

## Classification of "fizz buzz"
Based on [Joel Grus'](https://github.com/joelgrus) hilarious talk on using Tensorflow to solve "Fizz buzz". See [his repository](https://github.com/joelgrus/fizz-buzz-tensorflow) for the original work.

## One-dimensional Poisson equation
A Tensorflow 2.0 implementation of the [notes](https://krisbhei.github.io/DEnet/DNN_Diffeq/DNN_diffeq_html.html) by [Kristine Hein](https://github.com/krisbhei).

## One-dimensional wave equation
A Tensorflow 2.0 implementaion of the [notes](https://compphysics.github.io/MachineLearning/doc/pub/odenn/html/odenn.html) also by [Kristine Hein](https://github.com/krisbhei).
